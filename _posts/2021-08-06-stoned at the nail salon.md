ilk başlarda "``bu nası şarkı lorde?``" şeklinde tepki gösterip pek ısınamadığım şarkı. az önce kulaklığım takılı, *``lorde``*'un şarkılarından oluşan çalma listemi dinlerken bi anda uyanmam ve "``bu şarkı da ne böyle? ne kadar da güzel``" şeklinde bir tepki ile birlikte çok hoşuma giden şarkı.

### sözleri:

*Got a wishbone dryin' on the windowsill in my kitchen*

*Just in case I wake up and realize I've chosen wrong*

*I love this life that I have, the vine hangin' over the door*

*And the dog who comes when I call, but I wonder sometimes what I'm missin'*

*Well, my hot blood's been burnin' for so many summers now*

*It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads*

*'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses*

*And all the times they will change, it'll all come around*

*I don't know*

*Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon*

*Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again*

*Got a memory of waitin' in your bed wearin' only my earrings*

*We'd go dancin' all over the landmines under our town*

*But the sun has to rise, when it does, we'll divide up the papers*

*Two former hell-raisers, I'm still crazy for you, babe*

*Well, my hot blood's been burnin' for so many summers now*

*It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads*

*'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you'll grow out of*

*And all the times they will change, it'll all come around*

*I don't know*

*Maybe I'm just*

*Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again*

*Oh, make it good*

*Oh, make it good*

*I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel*

*'Round and 'round forever if I could*

*But it's time to cool it down*

*Whatever that means*

*Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you*

*'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around*

*I don't know*

*Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon*

*Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again*
