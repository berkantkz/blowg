this game has always been my favourite since the last couple of years and i have come across with lots of cheaters (both in team and opponent) always. for about a year, I almost ```never``` come across with them (only a few times). but in the last week, this is the 3rd time I am uninstalling the game. ```every``` single game there is/are obvious cheater(s) which make the game boring af and this pisses me off a lot. how'd it come to that stage from ```never```?
